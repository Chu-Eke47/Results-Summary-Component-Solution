## My process
  I started off with HTML which I structured by making two divs which served as the parent Flexbox of the layouts for the Result and Summary. The two flex containers were inside a section which made easy for the centering of the entire Result component on the webpage.

### Built with
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
  - Better analysis of component structure(s) for easier and more effective Mark-Up with HTML.
  - Effective Semantic HTML structuring and use of ID & Class(es) for better CSS writing and use of flexbox 
  - More understanding of the of gradient backgrounds and color sourcing.
  - 

### Continued development
  - General HTML and CSS mastery for more suffisticated and complex layouts/projects.
  - I will want and will appreciate all-round corrections and suggestions to help improve my web development skill and ability.
